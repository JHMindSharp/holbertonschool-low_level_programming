# C - Search Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and understanding different search algorithms, specifically linear and binary search. The objective is to learn about these algorithms, their time and space complexities, and appropriate use cases.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what a search algorithm is.
- Implement and understand linear and binary search algorithms.
- Learn to choose the appropriate search algorithm based on specific needs.
- Understand and apply the concept of Big O notation to evaluate algorithm complexity.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style.
- No global variables allowed.
- Maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Only the `printf` function of the standard library is allowed.

## Files
This repository contains the following files:

- `0-linear.c`: Implementation of the Linear Search algorithm.
- `1-binary.c`: Implementation of the Binary Search algorithm.
- `2-O`: File containing the time complexity of linear search.
- `3-O`: File containing the space complexity of linear search.
- `4-O`: File containing the time complexity of binary search.
- `5-O`: File containing the space complexity of binary search.
- `6-O`: File analyzing the space complexity of a given function.
- `search_algos.h`: Header file containing all function prototypes.

## Usage
To compile the code, use:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 <filename.c> -o <output_filename>

Replace `<filename.c>` and `<output_filename>` with the specific file and output name, respectively.
